    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Steel Cut Sushi "Rice"</h4>
    <p><li>Bring water to a boil, add oats. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 25-30 mins until al dente.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and strain in a mesh strainer. Run under cool water for 5 seconds to remove some of the starch. Shake all excess water off oats.</li>
        <li>Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, remove and allow to cool for 10 mins.</li>
        <li>If needed, shake any additional excess water off oats, add to a large mixing bowl and combine with rice vinegar mixture making sure it is thoroughly mixed.</li></p>
    <h4>Spicy California Avocado Roll</h4>
    <p><li>Using a sushi rolling mat wrapped with cling wrap, lay nori sheet on with the “rough” side up. Trim the nori if the piece is too large or to desired size you’d like. Place a thin layer of oats on the nori, gently press and spread the oats approx. 2/3-3/4 across the sheet leaving ¼-1/3 of the edge of one side uncovered towards the top.</li>
        <li>If you like spicy, squeeze one line of sriracha or shake togarashi across the center of the sheet.</li>
        <li>Lay the avocado, cucumber, and krab sticks in a thin line, adding the fillings to the bottom quarter of the nori.. Sprinkle with optional sesame seeds. Using the rolling mat, roll the sushi tightly up towards the top edge. Use a sharp knife to cut the roll in half and into half again, repeat until you have 8 pieces. Serve with wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce on the side.</li></p>
